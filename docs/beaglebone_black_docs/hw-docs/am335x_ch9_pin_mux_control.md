# **_Control Module_**

**9.1** **Introduction**


The control module includes status and control logic not addressed within the peripherals or the rest of the
device infrastructure. This module provides interface to control the following areas of the device:

     - Functional I/O multiplexing

     - Emulation controls

     - Device control and status

     - DDR PHY control and IO control registers

     - EDMA event multiplexing control registers


**Note:** For writing to the control module registers, the MPU will need to be in privileged mode of operation
and writes will not work from user mode.


**9.2** **Functional Description**


_**9.2.1**_ _**Control Module Initialization**_


The control module responds only to the internal POR and device type. At power on, reset values for the
registers define the safe state for the device. In the initialization mode, only modules to be used at boot
time are associated with the pads. Other module inputs are internally tied and output pads are turned off.
After POR, software sets the pad functional multiplexing and configuration registers to the desired values
according to the requested device configuration.


General-purpose (GP) devices include features that are inaccessible or unavailable. These inaccessible
registers define the default or fixed device configuration or behavior.


The CONTROL_STATUS[7:0] SYS_BOOT bit field reflects the state of the sys_boot pins captured at POR
in the PRCM module.


_**9.2.2**_ _**Pad Control Registers**_


The Pad Control Registers are 32-bit registers to control the signal muxing and other aspects of each I/O
pad. After POR, software must set the pad functional multiplexing and configuration registers to the
desired values according to the requested device configuration. The configuration is controlled by pads or
by a group of pads. Each configurable pin has its own configuration register for pullup/down control and
for the assignment to a given module.


The following table shows the generic Pad Control Register Description.


**Table 9-1. Pad Control Register Field Descriptions**

|Bit|Field|Value|Description|
|---|---|---|---|
|31-7|Reserved||Reserved. Read returns 0.|
|6|SLEWCTRL|0<br>1|Select between faster or slower slew rate.<br>Fast<br>Slow(1)|
|5|RXACTIVE|0<br>1|Input enable value for the Pad. Set to 0 for output only. Set to 1 for input or output.<br>Receiver disabled<br>Receiver enabled|
|4|PULLTYPESEL|0<br>1|Pad pullup/pulldown type selection<br>Pulldown selected<br>Pullup selected|
|3|PULLUDEN|0<br>1|Pad Pullup/pulldown enable<br>Pullup/pulldown enabled.<br>Pullup/pulldown disabled.|
|2-0|MUXMODE||Pad functional signal mux select|



(1) Some peripherals do not support slow slew rate. To determine which interfaces support each slew rate, see _AM335x Sitara Processors_
[(literature number SPRS717).


**9.2.2.1** **Mode Selection**


The MUXMODE field in the pad control registers defines the multiplexing mode applied to the pad. Modes
are referred to by their decimal (from 0 to 7) or binary (from 0b000 to 0b111) representation. For most
pads, the reset value for the MUXMODE field in the registers is 0b111. The exceptions are pads to be
used at boot time to transfer data from selected peripherals to the external flash memory.


**Table 9-2. Mode Selection**

|MUXMODE|Selected Mode|
|---|---|
|000b|Primary Mode = Mode 0|
|001b|Mode 1|
|010b|Mode 2|
|011b|Mode 3|
|100b|Mode 4|
|101b|Mode 5|
|110b|Mode 6|
|111b|Mode 7|



Mode 0 is the primary mode. When mode 0 is set, the function mapped to the pin corresponds to the
name of the pin. Mode 1 to mode 7 are possible modes for alternate functions. On each pin, some modes
are used effectively for alternate functions, while other modes are unused and correspond to no functional
configuration.

CAUTION
The multiplexer controlling the signal mode selection is not a glitch-free
structure. Thus, it is possible to see the signal glitch for a few nanoseconds
during the MUXMODE change. The user must ensure a glitch does not cause
contention or negatively impact an external device connected to the pad.

**9.2.2.2** **Pull Selection**


There is no automatic gating control to ensure that internal weak pull- down/pull up resistors on a pad are
disconnected whenever the pad is configured as output. If a pad is always configured in output mode, it is
recommended for user software to disable any internal pull resistor tied to it, to avoid unnecessary
consumption. The following table summarizes the various possible combinations of PULLTYPESEL and
PULLUDEN fields of PAD control register.


**Table 9-3. Pull Selection**

|PULL TYPE|Col2|Pin Behavior|
|---|---|---|
|PULLTYPESEL|PULLUDENABLE|PULLUDENABLE|
|0b|0b|Pulldown selected and activated|
|0b|1b|Pulldown selected but not activated|
|1b|0b|Pullup selected and activated|
|1b|1b|Pullup selected but not activated|



**9.2.2.3** **RX Active**


The RXACTIVE bit is used to enable and disable the input buffer. This control can be used to help with
power leakage or device isolation through the I/O. The characteristic of the signal is ultimately dictated by
the mux mode the pad is put into.

_**9.2.3**_ _**EDMA Event Multiplexing**_


The device has more DMA events than can be accommodated by the TPCC’s maximum number of
events, which is 64. To overcome the device has one crossbar at the top level. This module will multiplex
the extra events with all of the direct mapped events. Mux control registers are defined in the Control
Module to select the event to be routed to the TPCC. Direct mapped event is the default (mux selection
set to ‘0’).


**Event Crossbar**
```
                                |\
                                | \
Direct Mapped Event ----------->|0 \ 
Additional Event1   ----------->|1  \
Additional Event2   ----------->|2   \
Additional Event3   ----------->|3    |
                          |     |     | 
                          |     |     |--------> Event Out
                          |     |     |
                          |     |     |
                          |     |    /
                          |     |   /
Additional Event1   ----------->|32/^
                                | / | 
                                |/  |
                                    |
                                    |
                    Mux Selection in TPCC_EVT_MUX_m_n register
```

For every EDMA event there is a cross bar implemented in the design as shown in the figure.The direct
mapped event/interrupt will be always connected to Mux input[0], The additional events will be connected
to Mux input[1], Mux input[2].etc as defined in EDMA event table. The Mux selection value is programmed
into the corresponding TPCC_EVT_MUX_n register. The EVT_MUX value can take a value from 1 to 32.
Other values are reserved. By default the MUX_selection value is written to 0, which means the direct
mapped event is connected to the Event output.


When the additional event is selected through the Cross bar programming the direct mapped event cannot
be used.


For example, when TINT0 (Timer Interrupt 0) event, which is not directly mapped to the DMA event source
needs to be connected to EDMA channel no 24 (which is directly mapped to SDTXEVT0 event). The user
has to program the EVT_MUX_24 field in TPCC_EVT_MUX_24_27 register to 22 (value corresponding to
TINT0 interrupt in crossbar mapping). When this is set, TINT0 interrupt event will trigger the channel 24.


Please note that once this is set. The SDTXEVT0 can no longer be handled by EDMA. The user has to
allocate the correct DMA event number for crossbar mapped events so that there is no compromise on the
channel allocation for the used event numbers.


_**9.2.4**_ _**Device Control and Status**_


**9.2.4.1** **Control and Boot Status**


The device configuration is set during power on or hardware reset (PORz sequence) by the configuration
input pins (SYSBOOT[15:0]).The CONTROL_STATUS register reflects the system boot and the device
type configuration values as sampled when the power-on reset (PORz) signal is asserted. The
Configuration input pins are sampled continuously during the PORz active period and the final sampled
value prior to the last rising edge is latched in the register. The CONTROL_STATUS register gives the
status of the device boot process.

**9.2.4.2** **Interprocessor Communication**


The control module has the IPC_MSG_REG (7:0) registers which is for sharing messages between Cortex
M3 and the Cortex A8 MPU. The M3 TX end of event (M3_TXEV_EOI) register provides the mechanism
to clear/enable the TX Event from Cortex M3 to Cortex A8 MPU Subsystem. See the M3_TXEV_EOI
register description for further detail.


See Section 8.1.4.6, _Functional Sequencing for Power Management with Cortex M3_, for specific
information on how the IPC_MSG_REG registers are used to communicate with the Cortex-M3 firmware.


**9.2.4.3** **Initiator Priority Control**


The control module provides the registers to control the bus interconnect priority and the EMIF priority.


_**9.2.4.3.1**_ _**Initiator Priority Control for Interconnect**_


The INIT_PRIORITY_n register controls the infrastructure priority at the bus interconnects. This can be
used for dynamic priority escalation. There are bit fields that control the interconnect priority for each bus
initiator. By default all the initiators are given equal priority and the allocation is done on a round robin
basis.


The priority can take a value from 0 to 3. The following table gives the valid set of priority values.


**Table 9-4. Interconnect Priority Values**

|Interconnect Priority Value|Remarks|
|---|---|
|00|Low priority|
|01|Medium priority|
|10|Reserved|
|11|High priority|



_**9.2.4.3.2**_ _**Initiator Priority at EMIF**_


The MREQPRIO register provides an interface to change the access priorities for the various masters
accessing the EMIF(DDR). Software can make use of this register to set the requestor priorities for
required EMIF arbitration. The EMIF priority can take a value from 000b to 111b where 000b will be the
highest priority and 111b will be lowest priority.


**9.2.4.4** **Peripheral Control and Status**


_**9.2.4.4.1**_ _**USB Control and Status**_


The USB_CTRLn and USB_STSn registers reflect the Control and Status of the USB instances. The USB
IO lines can be used as UART TX and RX lines the USB Control register bit field GPIOMODE has settings
that configures the USB lines as GPIO lines. The other USB PHY control settings for controlling the OTG
settings and PHY are part of the USB_CTRLn register.


The USB_STSn register gives the status of the USB PHY module. See the USB_STSn register
description for further details.


See Section 16.1.4, _USB GPIO Details_, for more information.


_**9.2.4.4.2**_ _**USB Charger Detect**_


Each USB PHY contains circuitry which can automatically detect the presence of a charger attached to
the USB port. The charger detection circuitry is compliant to the Battery Charging Specification Revision
[1.1 from the USB Implementers Forum, which can be found at www.usb.org. See this document for more](http://www.usb.org)
details on USB charger implementation.


_**9.2.4.4.2.1**_ _**Features**_


The charger detection circuitry of each PHY has the following features:

     - Contains a state machine which can automatically detect the presence of a Charging Downstream Port
or a Dedicated Charging Port (see the Battery Charging Specification for the definition of these terms)

     - Outputs a charger enable signal (3.3 V level active high CMOS driver) when a charger is present.

     - Allows you to enable/disable the circuitry to save power

     - The detection circuitry requires only a 3.3-V supply to be present to operate.

     - The charger detection also has a manual mode which allows the user to implement the battery
charging specification in software.


_**9.2.4.4.2.2**_ _**Operation**_


The control module gives the following interface to control the automatic charger detection circuitry:

     - USB_CTRLx.CDET_EXTCTL: Turns the automatic detection on/off. Keep this bit 0 to keep the
automatic detection on. Changing this to 1 enables the manual mode.

     - USB_CTRLx.CHGDET_RSTRT: Restarts the charger detection state machine. To initiate the charger
detection, change this bit from 1 to 0. If this bit is 1, the charger enable output (CE) is disabled.

     - USB_CTRLx.CHGDET_DIS: Enables/disables the charger detection circuitry. Keep this bit 0 to keep
this charger detection enabled. Setting this bit to 1 will power down the charger detection circuitry.

     - USB_CTRLx.CM_PWRDN: Powers up/down the PHY which contains the charger detection circuitry.
Clear this bit to 0 to enable power to the PHY.


To start the charger detection during normal operation, ensure that the PHY and charger are enabled and
the automatic detection is turned on. Then, initiate a charger detection cycle by transitioning
CHGDET_RSTRT from 1 to 0. If a Charging Downstream Port or a Dedicated Charging Port is detected,
the charger enable signal (USBx_CE) will be driven high and remain high until the charger is disabled by
either CHGDET_DIS = 1 or CHGDET_RSTRT=1. If the port remains unconnected after intiating the
charger detect cycle, it will continue the detection until a charger is detected or an error condition occurs.
Note that USBx_CE is not an open drain output.


To disable the charger after successful detection, you must disable the charger detect circuitry with
CHGDET_DIS or CHGDET_RSTRT, even if the charger is physically disconnected.

Charger detection can be automatically started with no power to the rest of AM335x. If VDDA3P3V_USBx
is present, via an LDO powered by VBUS connected to a host, the charger detection state machine will
automatically start and perform detection. If a charger is detected, USBx_CE will be driven high, otherwise
it will be driven low.


The charger detection circuitry performs the following steps of the Battery Charging specification v1.1:

1. VBUS Detect

2. Data Contact Detect

3. Primary Detection


Secondary Detection (to distinguish between a Charging Downstream Port and a Dedicated Charging
Port) is a newly added feature of the v1.2 spec and is not implemented in the charger detection state
machine.


**NOTE:** The USBx_CE output will only operate when the corresponding USBx_ID pin is grounded
(indicating USB host mode). The USBx_CE output does not operate in peripheral mode
(when USBx_ID is floating).


_**9.2.4.4.3**_ _**Ethernet MII Mode Selection**_


The control module provides a mechanism to select the Mode of operation of Ethernet MII interface. The
GMII_SEL register has register bit fields to select the MII/RMII/RGMII modes, clock sources, and delay
mode.


_**9.2.4.4.4**_ _**Ethernet Module Reset Isolation Control**_


This feature allows the device to undergo a warm reset without disrupting the switch or traffic being routed
through the switch during the reset condition. The CPSW Reset Isolation register (RESET_ISO) has an
ISO_CONTROL field which controls the reset isolation feature.


If the reset isolation is enabled, any warm reset source will be blocked to the EMAC switch. If the EMAC
reset isolation is NOT active (default state), then the warm reset sources are allowed to propagate as
normal including to the EMAC Switch module (both reset inputs to the IP). All cold or POR resets will
always propagate to the EMAC switch module as normal.


When RESET_ISO is enabled, the following registers will not be disturbed by a warm reset:

     - GMII_SEL

     - CONF_GPMC_A[11:0]

     - CONF_GPMC_WAIT0

     - CONF_GPMC_WPN

     - CONF_GPMC_BEN1

     - CONF_MII1_COL

     - CONF_MII1_CRS

     - CONF_MII1_RX_ER

     - CONF_MII1_TX_EN

     - CONF_MII1_RX_DV

     - CONF_MII1_TXD[3:0]

     - CONF_MII1_TX_CLK

     - CONF_MII1_RX_CLK

     - CONF_MII1_RXD[3:0]

     - CONF_RMII1_REF_CLK

     - CONF_MDIO

     - CONF_MDC


_**9.2.4.4.5**_ _**Timer/eCAP Event Capture Control**_


The Timer 5, 6, 7 events and the eCAP0, 1, 2 events can be selected using the TIMER_EVT_CAPTURE
and ECAP_EVT_CAPTURE registers. The following table lists the available sources for those events.

_**9.2.4.4.6**_ _**ADC Capture Control**_


The following chip level events can be connected through the software-controlled multiplexer to the
TSC_ADC module.

1. PRU-ICSS Host Event 0

2. Timer 4 Event

3. Timer 5 Event

4. Timer 6 Event

5. Timer 7 Event


This pin is the external hardware trigger to start the ADC channel conversion. The ADC_EVT_CAPT
register needs to programmed to select the proper source for this conversion.

_**9.2.4.4.7**_ _**SRAM LDO Control**_


The device incorporates two instances of the SRAM LDO (VSLDO) module. One of these LDOs powers
the ARM internal SRAM and the other powers the OCMC SRAMs. In the SMA2 register, the
VSLDO_CORE_AUTO_RAMP_EN bit, when set, allows the VSLDO, which powers the OCMC SRAMs, to
be put into retention during deepsleep and enable lower power consumption. Since the VSLDO is shared
between WKUP M3 memories and CORE memories, the VSLDO has to be brought out of retention on
any wakeup event. This bit allows this functionality and should be set to allow proper sleep/wakeup
operation during Standby and DeepSleep modes. Similar functionality is not necessary for the LDO
powering the ARM internal SRAM. It can be put in retention mode using PRM_LDO_SRAM_MPU_CTRL.

**9.3.1.75** **dpll_pwr_sw_ctrl Register (offset = 1318h) [reset = 0h]**


The DPLL_PWR_SW_CTRL register, in conjunction with the DPLL_PWR_SW_STATUS register, can be
used to power off the digital power domain of the 3 DPLLS – DDR, DISP, PER to save leakage power in
deep-sleep power modes. This register gives control over the power switch signals of the individual
DPLLS.


A specific sequence has to be followed while programming the RET, PONIN, PGOODIN, ISO and RESET
signals to put the PLLs in to low power mode and bring it out of low power mode.


In normal operating mode, the PRCM controls the RESET of the DPLLS. The RET, PONIN, PGOODIN
and ISO are tied off. An over-ride bit is provided in this register SW_CTRL_*_RESET, which when set
allows S/W to control the RESET, RET, PONIN, PGOODIN and ISO of the DPLLs to enable entry/exit into
DPLL low power modes.
